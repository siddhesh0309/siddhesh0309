Thanks for the call today.
	•	We got a walkthrough of the Traces utility used to convert raw files into TDS certificate PDFs.
	•	Certificates are segregated based on:
	•	IB (Internet Banking)
	•	Emailing
	•	Physical dispatch
	•	EY shares the certificate folder, which the Tax team sends to the vendor via SFTP.
	•	The vendor sends emails to customers and shares bounce-back details with the Tax team.
	•	For undelivered emails, the vendor sends the certificates via post to those customers.

We’ll schedule another session to walk through the segregation process in detail and then assess automation feasibility.
