Thanks for the call today.
	•	We got a walkthrough of the Traces utility used to convert raw files into TDS certificate PDFs.
	•	Certificates are segregated based on:
	•	IB (Internet Banking)
	•	Emailing
	•	Physical dispatch
	•	EY shares the certificate folder, which the Tax team sends to the vendor via SFTP.
	•	The vendor sends emails to customers and shares bounce-back details with the Tax team.
	•	For undelivered emails, the vendor sends the certificates via post to those customers.

We’ll schedule another session to walk through the segregation process in detail and then assess automation feasibility.



from OpenSSL import crypto

# Load certificate and private key
with open(CERT_PATH, "rb") as f:
    cert = crypto.load_certificate(crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, f.read())

with open(KEY_PATH, "rb") as f:
    key = crypto.load_privatekey(crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, f.read())

# Convert payload to compact JSON and sign it
json_data = json.dumps(payload, separators=(',', ':')).encode('utf-8')
signed = crypto.sign(key, json_data, "sha256")

# Convert to base64 string to add into payload
return base64.b64encode(signed).decode()
